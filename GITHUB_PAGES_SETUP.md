# 🔧 Fix GitHub Pages Deployment Error

## ❌ **The Error You're Seeing:**
```
Error: Get Pages site failed. Please verify that the repository has Pages enabled and configured to build using GitHub Actions
Error: Not Found - https://docs.github.com/rest/pages/pages#get-a-apiname-pages-site
```

## ✅ **Step-by-Step Fix:**

### **1. Enable GitHub Pages**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click the **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll down to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
5. Click **"Save"**

### **2. Verify Repository Structure**
Make sure your repository has:
```
your-repo/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml ✅
├── ats-alumni/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json ✅
│   ├── next.config.ts ✅
│   └── ...
└── DEPLOYMENT.md ✅
```

### **3. Check Workflow Permissions**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Under **"Workflow permissions"**:
   - Select **"Read and write permissions"**
   - Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
3. Click **"Save"**

### **4. Push Your Code**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### **5. Monitor Deployment**
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Watch the **"Deploy ATS Alumni Website to GitHub Pages"** workflow
3. If it fails, check the logs for specific errors

## 🚀 **Alternative: Quick Vercel Deployment**

If GitHub Pages continues to have issues, deploy to Vercel instead:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Navigate to project
cd ats-alumni

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Y
# - Which scope? (select your account)
# - Link to existing project? N
# - What's your project's name? ats-alumni
# - In which directory is your code located? ./
# - Want to override the settings? N
```

## 🔍 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: "Repository not found"**
- Make sure the repository is public, or you have proper permissions
- Check that you're logged into the correct GitHub account

### **Issue 2: "Workflow failed"**
- Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
- Ensure all required files are present
- Verify the workflow file syntax

### **Issue 3: "Pages not enabled"**
- Double-check that Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Make sure "GitHub Actions" is selected as the source

### **Issue 4: "Build errors"**
```bash
# Try building locally first
cd ats-alumni
npm install
npm run build

# If it builds locally but fails on GitHub:
# - Check Node.js version in workflow (currently set to 18)
# - Verify all dependencies are in package.json
```

## 📋 **Quick Checklist**

- [ ] Repository has GitHub Pages enabled
- [ ] Source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- [ ] Workflow permissions are set correctly
- [ ] All files are committed and pushed
- [ ] Workflow file exists in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- [ ] `next.config.ts` has export configuration
- [ ] Package.json has export script

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After following these steps:
1. Your workflow should run automatically on push
2. GitHub will build and deploy your site
3. Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`

## 🆘 **Still Having Issues?**

If you're still getting errors:

1. **Check the Actions tab** for detailed error messages
2. **Try a manual trigger**: Go to Actions → Select workflow → "Run workflow"
3. **Use a different deployment method**: Vercel, Netlify, or other hosting platforms
